    "question": "How do you use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in C# to query data, and what are the benefits of using it?",
    "answer": "LINQ in C# is used to query data by providing a set of extension methods that can be applied to any enumerable object. It allows developers to write SQL-like code in C# to query and transform data, making it easier to work with data in a type-safe and expressive way. The benefits of using LINQ include improved readability, reduced code complexity, and increased productivity, as it eliminates the need to write boilerplate code for data querying and manipulation.",
